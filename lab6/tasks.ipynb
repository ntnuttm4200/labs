    "   * Set up and analyze a firewall.\n",
    "   * Understand symmetric and public-key encryption by setting up and analyzing TLS for secure TCP connections.\n",
    "   * Set up and analyze VPNs for secure network tunneling.\n",
    "   * Understand the principles of sender authentication and message integrity by applying and verifying digital signatures. \n",

    "The lab has several **milestones**. Make sure you reach each one before advancing to the next but try to skim through the whole lab before you start.\n",
