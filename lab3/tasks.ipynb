    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this lab is to learn TCP and UDP socket programming by building a simple network application program (chat application) and analyzing TCP and UDP connections. The lab has several **milestones**. Make sure you reach each one before advancing to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "For delivery, see Milestone 5. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## System Setup  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will build a chatroom using a client-server architecture with TCP sockets and a peer-to-peer (p2p) chat with UDP sockets, as shown in Figure 1. The overall procedure is for clients to connect to the server via TCP and register with their name. The server broadcasts information of new clients and public messages to all connected clients. Clients can also chat with each other using direct UDP connections.\n",

    "* __Use the same docker files as in lab2. You can run your chat server application in the \"webserver\" container and the chat client in \"client1\", \"client2\" containers__\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can write the code in JupyterLab or your favorite python IDE. The code cell has the [magic command](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html)`%%writefile`, which write the contents of the cell to a file, then copy the code files to the container either using `scp` or the mounted volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To get an overview of using sockets in python, read this [Python HOWTO](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.html) (<https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.html>), which discuss TCP sockets. Additionally, you can read section 2.7 of the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We will also use threading to enable running multiple sockets concurrently. You can have a look at this [tutorial](https://dzone.com/articles/python-thread-part-1) (<https://dzone.com/articles/python-thread-part-1>), to get a brief introduction to python threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, we will use _json_ for serializing data ([TTM4175](https://ttm4175.iik.ntnu.no/iot-http-json-2020.html) (<https://ttm4175.iik.ntnu.no/iot-http-json-2020.html>)).\n"
