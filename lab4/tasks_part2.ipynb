    "The goal of this lab is to learn how to implement and analyze a reliable transport protocol. The lab has several **milestones**. Make sure you reach each one before advancing to the next.\n",

    "\n",
    "## System Setup \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will implement GO-BACK-N (__GBN__) as a reliable transport protocol on top of UDP. This will ensure reliable transmission of packets in the presence of packet loss, packet corruption, and Network delay (read section 3.4.3 of the book). You will use the same setup as in part1; see figure 1.\n",

    "For simplicity, the sender reads a text file and creates a packet from every line of text (every line will be the payload of a single packet).\n",
    "The receiver will extract the lines from the received packets and write them to a text file.\n",

    "We implemented an \"end of transmission signal\" by sending an empty packet. The receiver checks every packet (in the \"rcvpkt\" method), and if it finds an empty packet, it will close the socket. However, if the \"end of transmission signal\" gets lost, the receiver will keep the socket open forever.\n",
