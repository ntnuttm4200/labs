Your job is to configure a routing protocol in the routers to have connectivity to non-directly connected networks, and to setup NAT in order to access the servers from the private networks. Additionally, you will setup DHCP to dynamically assign IP addresses to clients in your private networks.\n",

    "# Milestone 1 -- Network Addressing and Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "In this milestone, you will learn how to setup a routing protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, the IP addresses have already been set, but the routers only know the directly connected networks. Thus they can not forward packets to non-directly connected networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Check the routing table in the routers (router0, router1, router2, and router3) and try to understand every line in the output based on Figure 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ip route show\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can try pinging the Webserver from router1. Do you get any response?\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ping 129.100.1.3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To have connectivity, we need to update the routing tables with the correct paths to forward packets. We can do this using either static or dynamic routing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In static routing, we manually enter routes in the routing table, but this can be a daunting task, especially in larger networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In dynamic routing, we configure a routing protocol that instructs routers to exchange information with other routers, then automatically learn routes and update the routing table.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * In distance-vector protocols (RIP, EIGRP, BGP ... etc.), routers describe available paths (i.e., routes) to their neighbors.\n",
    "    * In link-state protocols (OSPF, IS-IS, ... etc.), routers describe the state of their links to all other routers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this lab., we will use OSPF as an example, but it is straightforward to use any other routing protocol. [OSPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First) is link-state routing protocol in which routers describe their link-state in a message called link-state advertisement (LSA). Then each router constructs a topology map of the network and calculate the shortest path using [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)"

We installed FRR in the routers and enabled the OSPF daemon by default.\n",
